      <h1>Pragraph For The Future</h1>
      <p>Right now all modern technology is designed to be bring the world to you: 
      <br>phone,radio,television,internet,
      <br>But,if trens continue,robots will soon bring you to the world,every where and the speed of thought.
      <br>A mind and a hand where it is needed while you sit safely at home and run the show.
      <br>It is a future goal -- some times we know we can do if we can urge the market towards it.
      <br>But it is one I like , and might even be able to something about.
      <br>If works , robots will not just change your lives in the future, they will expend them.
      <br>Not just for fun,but for necessity.
      <br>We have taken the first steps welcoming into our homes,we just have to wait a bit to proctor them into making us more human.</p>
